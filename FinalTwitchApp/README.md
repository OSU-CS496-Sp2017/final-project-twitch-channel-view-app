Twitch Final Project App

CS 496

Scott Russell

This app displays a list of the Top 10 Most popular Games of Twitch currently

Selecting a game will bring up a window with more detailed information (Channels playing that game, total views, ect)

Scrolling down from the top will reload the games, possibly changing the order based on if games outrank one another

Planning on implimenting a Settings Tab where the User can store information for future.
(possible create a second tab for favorited games, and be able to add games to the favorite from the detailed view)
